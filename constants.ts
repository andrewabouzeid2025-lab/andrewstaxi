//  PRICE LIST — HOW TO EDIT (no coding knowledge needed)
//
//  1. Each line below is ONE route and its price in US dollars.
//  2. Direction does not matter. Airport -> Jounieh is the same price as
//     Jounieh -> Airport. Write each route only ONCE.
//  3. To change a price, edit the number after   oneWay:
//  4. roundTrip: is optional. Leave it out and the return price is
//     automatically the one-way price x 2. Add   roundTrip: 60,   to
//     charge something different.
//  5. To add a route, copy any line and change from / to / oneWay.
//     The from and to values MUST match an   id:   in ZONES above.
//  6. Any route NOT listed here shows "Price on request" and sends the
//     customer to WhatsApp with their trip details already filled in.
//     Nothing breaks — you just quote that one by hand.
//
//  THE LIST IS EMPTY ON PURPOSE. Until Andrew confirms his prices, every
//  route quotes on request. Add a line and that price goes live immediately.
//
//  Example (delete the // to switch it on):
//  { from: 'bey-airport', to: 'jounieh', oneWay: 35 },
